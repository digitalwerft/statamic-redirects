## How it works


## Configuration

* **Enable auto redirects** Enable to let the module keep track of changed URLs when moving pages or changing slugs,
and automatically redirects old URLs to the new ones.
* **Log 404s** Log any 404 requests and show them in the 404 monitor.
* **Access to manage redirects** Restrict access to view and manage redirects to certain roles. If empty, all roles are able to view and manage. Enter role slugs.
